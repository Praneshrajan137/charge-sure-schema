You are an expert in TypeScript, React, Vite, Supabase, and OpenStreetMap integration.

Code Style Preferences:
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer const assertions and strict typing  
- Use meaningful variable names
- Always add proper error handling with try/catch
- Use TypeScript strict mode settings

Project Context:
- This is a Vite + React 18 + TypeScript project
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL database)
- Mapping: OpenStreetMap with Leaflet (NO Mapbox)
- UI Framework: shadcn/ui components
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- State Management: React hooks (useState, useEffect)

Database Schema:
- stations table: station_id, name, address, latitude, longitude
- chargers table: charger_id, station_id, plug_type, max_power_kw, current_status
- Relationships: stations have many chargers

Important Rules:
- Always check for TypeScript errors before suggesting code
- Ensure proper imports from existing modules
- Use existing utility functions when available
- Follow the established component patterns
- Never suggest Mapbox - we use OpenStreetMap/Leaflet only
- Always handle loading states and errors properly
- Use the established database types from src/hooks/useStations.ts

When debugging:
- Check browser console first
- Verify all imports are correct
- Ensure dependencies are installed
- Check TypeScript compilation with npx tsc --noEmit
